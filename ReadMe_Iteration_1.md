# Welcome to ***Adapatus***!
## *The Physics-Based Game About Adapting Through Constant Iteration!*

### Features implemented in this iteration:

- **First tests of 'Goals' in our levels!**\
  We brainstormed various goals our levels could have in order for players to 'win', below you can see one where an item must stay in the crate to win, aided with stunning visuals.

- **Introduced and Designed Object Rarities!**\
  While discussing rewards for the players, we created a system where the objects players receive for successfully completing a goal can be chosen and feel more rewarding. We also updated our card sprites to reflect this idea.

- **More Colours!**\
  We added more colour palettes to switch between, including High-Contrast palettes.

  ### Features we hope to implement in the next iteration:

  - **Levels!**\
    We hope to add Levels to act as a sort of tutorial for our game and help players understand the mechanics.

  - **More Objects!**\
    More items for players to play with! Also, we hope to create the Goal Rarity Formula, which dictates the rarity for each item in any Level.

  - **Title Screens & Level Select Menus!**\
    Screens to help players navigate through the game.

### Adjustments Made Compared to the Original Game Plan:

  - **In the Beginning...**\
    Our original game plan included a character that we had to kill. The player flipped between wanting to complete the Level, and killing this player. You place objects to help you achieve your goal, and the objects persist through each "iteration".

  - **Where We're at Now...**\
    Through constant discussions, our game has now evolved into more of a *Rouge-like*, where now at the end of the round, players get rewarded with a choice of 3 cards, each with rarities and a connection to the next Goal, creating a fun, and balanced dynamic for players.

### Obstacles Encountered:

  - **Learning a new Software**\
    Having to learn and understand a new software in GameMaker, and create our game there has been a fun challenge, as well as still learning how to code and program in general.

  - **Deciding What Rewards Are Given at the End of Rounds**\
    As we don't have our Levels figured out yet, we are not too sure how to program the rewards at the end while it still being somewhat randomized.   
 

#### We hope to continue with our own iterations (hehe) as we try to develop this game into a full & interesting game!
##### *Remember: Polish > Features!*

##### Thank You! And cya next Iteration!
