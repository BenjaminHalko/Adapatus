# Welcome to ***Adapatus***!
## *The Physics-Based Game About Adapting Through Constant Iteration!*

> Iteration One:

> ### Features implemented in this iteration:

> - **First tests of 'Goals' in our levels!**\
>  We brainstormed various goals our levels could have in order for players to 'win', below you can see one where an item must stay in the crate to win, aided with stunning visuals.

> ![Goal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aebc96f2-9611-4983-9885-a46c573f39ae)

> - **Introduced and Designed Object Rarities!**\
>  While discussing rewards for the players, we created a system where the objects players receive for successfully completing a goal can be chosen and feel more rewarding. We also updated our card sprites to reflect this idea.

> ![Cards](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc82ebc-c9b1-407d-9cf0-f23fff095b8c)

> - **More Colours!**\
>  We added more colour palettes to switch between, including High-Contrast palettes.

> ![Colours](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecc4f5b7-cf37-486e-aa57-06f0ec63b275)

>  ### Features we hope to implement in the next iteration:

>  - **Levels!**\
>    We hope to add Levels to act as a sort of tutorial for our game and help players understand the mechanics.

>  - **More Objects!**\
>    More items for players to play with! Also, we hope to create the Goal Rarity Formula, which dictates the rarity for each item in any Level.

>  - **Title Screens & Level Select Menus!**\
>    Screens to help players navigate through the game.

> ### Adjustments Made Compared to the Original Game Plan:

>  - **In the Beginning...**\
>    Our original game plan included a character that we had to kill. The player flipped between wanting to complete the Level, and killing this player. You place objects to help you achieve your goal, and the objects persist through each "iteration".

>  - **Where We're at Now...**\
>    Through constant discussions, our game has now evolved into more of a *Rouge-like*, where now at the end of the round, players get rewarded with a choice of 3 cards, each with rarities and a connection to the next Goal, creating a fun, and balanced  >     dynamic for players.

> ### Obstacles Encountered:

>  - **Learning a new Software**\
    Having to learn and understand a new software in GameMaker, and create our game there has been a fun challenge, as well as still learning how to code and program in general.

>  - **Deciding What Rewards Are Given at the End of Rounds**\
    As we don't have our Levels figured out yet, we are not too sure how to program the rewards at the end while it is still being somewhat randomized.\   
 

**Iteration Two:**

Welcome Back!\
We've continued to progress our game with implementations of some exiting new elements and physics improvements! 

### Features implemented in this iteration:

- **BOINGGG!**\
  Springs are here!\
  A great addition to our elements that allows players to propel anything they need to the stratosphere!

  ![Spring-ezgif com-optimize](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b67ffeeb-f867-4592-b395-7b39304aff18)

- **Rope!**\
  Our new element - Rope - brings about a great new mechanic to our game!\
  With it, a player can make and design contraptions out of their wildest imaginations, connecting rope to various items makes the possibilities and dynamics between elements quite possibly endless and the results super exciting!\
  Especially when used in tangent with our next element...

- **Balloons!**\
  Thats right! Our very own floatable fortitude of an element, tasked with carrying even the heaviest of objects (Given you've got enough balloons of course)!\
  This element has been super fun to develop, test and play with. Still, of course, it came with its challenges of having to revamp our physics engine & values to incorporate this element being able to float things away!

  ![Balloons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0099cff7-cc12-4552-a383-8df72bfe32de)

- **Snapping & Transitioning Systems!**\
  Allows a player to better understand the elements that can be connected together with a slight magnet to the cursor!

- **Good Ol' Bug Fixes!**\
  Many bugs squashed in this update due to the complexity of the elements introduced, as well as adjustments to our physics engine and density values to make sure our elements feel natural in gameplay!

### Features we hope to implement in the next iteration:

- **More Dynamic & Fun Elements!**\
  We have a ton of exciting elements players can play around with coming very soon, here's a sneak peek...

- **Let there be FIRE!**\
  We also have a new spreadable element planned to come very soon!\
  It can help players achieve various goals and cause even more chaos!

### Obstacles Encountered:

- **Physics Phenomena & a Bunch'a Bugs**\
  As mentioned before, due to the elements heavily relying on our game physics and values, we've had to go back and almost overhaul all our values.\
  Additionally, just the few hundred bugs that came with these elements too! 

#### We hope to continue with our own iterations (hehe) as we try to develop this game into a full & interesting game!
##### *Remember: Polish > Features!*

##### Thank You Once Again! And cya next Iteration!
